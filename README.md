## How to Play 🧠
1. Choose the game mode: **Single Player** or **Two Player**.
2. Enter player names (if in Two Player mode).
3. In **Single Player** mode, you'll play against a bot that randomly places its moves. The game will have a slight delay (around 1 second) for the bot's move.
4. In **Two Player** mode, Player 1 will play as X, and Player 2 will play as O. Take turns clicking on the empty cells to place your symbol.
5. The game will notify you when a player wins, or if there is a draw (no more moves left).
6. You can restart the game anytime.
